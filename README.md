# Ebook-maker
Webcrawler that can create ebook from websites ( for light-novels)
The code used is a python code.
FOR THE FILE "rmji.py"
Process is simple, webcrawler creates a whole data set in csv file which is converted to an html file, 
from there you can convert it to pdf/ebook from free online resources.

FOR THE FILE "single ebook creator.py"
This will create the whole ebook without any need for third party conversion, but the restriction is that the code needs to be executed
for every page individually and you will have to combine all those ebook later.
